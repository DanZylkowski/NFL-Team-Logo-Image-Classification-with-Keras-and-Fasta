# NFL-Team-Logo-Image-Classification-with-Keras-and-Fasta
Image classification is an exciting subclass of computer vision. Important uses cases for image classification include identifying cancer in X-rays or allowing self-driving cars to identify objects in the road. For this project the use case would be enable online retailers to identify the name of the team based on a picture of a logo. This project aims to classify the images of the logos of 31 of the 32 NFL teams. The Washington Football Team is not being included in this analysis since the team has no current logo and will not have a new logo until 2022. This project will use deep learning to create a robust CNN model that will accurately classify NFL team logo images.

The images used in the project can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aM-0xHmFzcPjx1pa0hImghVUhezYLkfa).
