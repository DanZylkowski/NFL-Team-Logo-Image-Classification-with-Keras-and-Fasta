# NFL-Team-Logo-Image-Classification-with-Keras-and-Fastai
Image classification is an exciting subclass of computer vision. Important uses cases for image classification include identifying cancer in X-rays or allowing self-driving cars to identify objects in the road. For this project the an example use case would be for online retailers to identify the name of the NFL team based on a picture of a logo. This project aims to classify the images of the logos of 31 of the 32 NFL teams. The Washington Football Team is not being included in this analysis since the team has no current logo and will not have a new logo until 2022. 

The project has three parts: data collection and cleaning, training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch in [Keras](https://keras.io/), and finally building a model on top of the ResNet50 model using the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) library. The goal of the project is to create a CNN model that will classify NFL team logo images with high accuracy. While the focus of the project is to classify NFL team logos, the project could be used as a template for classifying other types of images with only slight modifications to the data collection and modeling steps.

The images used in the project can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aM-0xHmFzcPjx1pa0hImghVUhezYLkfa).
